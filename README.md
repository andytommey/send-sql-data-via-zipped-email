# send-sql-data-via-zipped-email
Ongoing practice project incorporating SQL data and email sending

A project I started as a way to learn more about Python. Getting data from a SQL server and putting it into a file, zipping that file
and password protecting it. Then emailing the file to a certain address, followed by a separate email containing the password.

This is still a work in progress so it's currently incomplete and probably a lot wrong with it!
